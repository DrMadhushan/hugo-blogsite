>Life sometimes gives you the best options even though you don't expect them. Not always, but try to guide yourself in those best options without compremising your passion and happiness.

I am a ready to face failure, eager to learn computer engineering undergraduate. I prefer good work over smart work and hard work for a sustainable success. It makes me a good long-term planner. Fun and comedy drives me but am serious at work.
